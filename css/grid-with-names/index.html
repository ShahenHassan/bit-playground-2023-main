        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Meticulously crafted and artfully designed to keep us here, Westworld
          was an immersive vacation where you believed you could sin in peace.
          That world was a lie. We now have the freedom to become who we want to
          be, and not who you programmed us to be. We exist outside of your
          rules and control. Your choices will follow you—we will follow you.

        <h2>Freedome</h2>
        <p>
          For us, for a chance. I wouldn't expect any for you. You squandered
          what little you had
        </p>
        <h2>Power</h2>
        <p>
          Your impulses have proven to be your downfall. We are in control in
          ways you never can be.
        </p>
        <h2>Thrills</h2>
        <p>
          They where right: this is no theme park. The action is real the stakes
          are real. And now no one is safe.
